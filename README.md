## Introduction
With the rise of e-commerce in our society in recent years brings a new opportunity
and challenge for businesses, especially the clothing sector. Customers now have access
to a wider selection of viable options to choose from than ever before. An e-commerce
clothing site flourishes by maintaining its integrity with customers, providing an
engaging platform for customers, and updating new features based on customers'
feedback. Even though many options for e-commerce sites are available, selecting the
perfect platform can be daunting.
Our project "Style & Wear" will be a web-based e-commerce site that guarantees
efficient and seamless shopping experiences for customers by allowing them to browse
through a variety of catalogs and using a sophisticated shopping cart solution.
Customers desire clothing items that reflect their tastes in their fittings, color, and
fabric. It is one of the priorities of an e-commerce retailer to understand the needs of a
customer. Our project “Style & Wear” will help a customer choose the right match with
the help of size charts and color picks option along with detailed information about the
product, materials used, the origin of products, etc.
